# FFR120_group_project
The project explores the use case of small nerual networks and genetic algorithms on the Sugarscape model. The Sugarscape model is a resource distrbution model intended to investigate how resources flow between individuals, groups or within groups, mainly for survival. Agents are initalized to gather resources placed on a grid. After a certain time, agents can either die, survive, or multiply, based on the status of their resources. The new agents can have enhanced capabilities (such as they can move longer distances in the grid) or worsened based on a feature we call "polution". Here, we wanted to implement generational trauma and study how the affect of worsened capabilities trickeld down on future generations abilities to gather resources.
