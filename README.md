# FFR120_group_project
This project explores the use of small neural networks and genetic algorithms in the Sugarscape model, a resource‑distribution framework used to study how resources flow between individuals or groups for survival. Agents are initialized on a grid to gather resources. After a certain time, agents may die, survive or multiply based on their resource levels. New agents can inherit enhanced capabilities (e.g., the ability to move longer distances) or suffer reduced capabilities if they have been exposed to “pollution” cells that negatively affect reproduction. Here, we wanted to implement a form of generational trauma to study how the effect of reduced capabilities trickled down to future generations’ ability to gather resources.
